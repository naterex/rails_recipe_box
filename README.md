This is a project to make an online Recipie Box using Ruby on Rails.

Users can create recipies that include mutiple ingredients and directions for each one.

I made this project because I wanted to learn about:
  - using HAML (HTML Abstraction Markup Language) instead of ERB
  - using the gem simple_form to add forms
  - how to make nested forms using the Cocoon gem
  - enabling image uploading for users
  - using the gem Devise for user sign up and login

## Stack
  - Ruby version: 2.2.1
  - Rails version: 4.2.4
  - Database: SQLite
  - Frontend: Bootstrap
  - HAML markup language instead of ERB
