This is a project to make an online Recipie Box using Ruby on Rails.

Users can create recipies that include mutiple ingredients and directions for each one.

I made this project because I wanted to learn about:
  - how to make nested forms using the Cocoon gem
  - enabling image uploading for users
  - using the gem Devise for user sign up and login
